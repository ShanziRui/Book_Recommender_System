# Book_Recommender_System
Conjunction of two recommender engines, one is rating based and the other is content based.

There are three folders with PY files:
Contexts Based (PY): contains the processing files for contexts-based recommendation engine, including contexts_loading.py, contexts_modeling.py, contexts_preprocessing.py.

Ratings Based (PY): contains the processing files for ratings-based recommendation engine,  including rating_preprocessing.py, SVDpp_modeling.py.

Final Recommendation System (PY): contains the final recommendation system embedded with both two engines, named as recommender.py.

	e.g. "pride-and-prejudice" contains 61 chapters in total, the program creates 61 txt files for each chapter, stores in the folder named "pride-and-prejudice-chapters"

- A csv file named "book_contexts.csv" which contains three conlumns and 10 rows, each row stands for one book with its corpus representations.




Ratings-based Engine
---------------------

Run rating_preprocessing.py to see the data preparation and basic statistics of the ratings data, run SVDpp_modeling.py to see the ratings_recommender engine.

The output information printed in order:

- A visualization named "distribution_of_ratings.png"

- A visualization named "mean_book_rating.png"

- A visualization named "mean_user_rating.png"

- A visualization named "number_of_ratings_per_book.png"

- A visualization named "number_of_ratings_per_user.png"

- A csv file named "performance.csv" contains the evaluation result for 11 algorithms.
